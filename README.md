#NY Times API Portal

I wrote this to work with the NY Times API.  Content is generated with jquery calls to the DOM / Form elements, and AJAX calls to the NYtimes API.  Content is created in its own bootstrap containers as needed and prepended to the DOM elements. 

Toolsets used: Bootstrap, Jquery, Ajax, JSON, Random Offsets, Javascript, CSS
