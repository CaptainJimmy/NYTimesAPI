#NY Times API Portal

I wrote this to work with the NY Times API. It is actually three different APIs.  Content is generated with jquery calls to the DOM / Form elements, and AJAX calls to the NYtimes APIs (search, top stories, and most popular).  Content is created in its own bootstrap containers as needed and prepended to the DOM elements. 

Toolsets used: APIs,  Jquery, Ajax, JSON, Javascript, CSS, Bootstrap,
